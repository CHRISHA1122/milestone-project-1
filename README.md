* I used a colour picker extension built in to the browser to identify useful colours.
* The primary colour choices of dark blue and white were chosen because they have a clean clear aspect while contrasting well with each other.
* Black and Grey were chosen to make the writing stand out against the background.
* Most colours used were taken from the logo or image from the home page.
* The light blue was taken from facebook homepage and used because it is a recognisable social media colour.

#### Styling

* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) was used throughout the project for its built in styling capabilities.
* The same header/nav bar and footer used on each page for easy navigation.
* Hover added on the main elements.
* Different certificates added at different stage of responsive design so always visible to the clients.
* Clickable links open in a new page.

#### Backgrounds

* Home page background image used as an easy recognisable company van.
* About page background image used as a friendly face.
* Contact page background image used to showcase someone working.
